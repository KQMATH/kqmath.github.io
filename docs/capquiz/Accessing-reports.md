# Accessing reports
CAPQuiz supports a "Report" sub-plugin type.

CAPQuiz reports are CAPQuiz sub-plugins. They are mainly intended to display custom reports on the quiz data. However, they may also provide other functionality.

## Viewing reports
All CAPQuiz reports may be found under the `Reports` tab. When the `Reports` tab is clicked, a sub menu of tabs are displayed. All installed CAPQuiz reports are listed in these tabs.

It is only users with the `viewreports` privilege that may access a report (this includes teachers as default). 

## CAPQuiz report types
Currently, CAPQuiz ships with the following reports:
* [Attempts report](Attempts-report)
* [Questions report](Questions-report)
