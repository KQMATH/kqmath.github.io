# Creating a new quiz
CAPQuiz is an activity module, and a quiz is created like other activities.
During the creation of the quiz, one are presented with several setup stages.

A CAPQuiz activity consists of mainly two parts:

1. The actual activity module instance.
2. Question lists.

## Adding a new CAPQuiz instance
The first setup procedure is to add the CAPQuiz activity to a course.
The setup consists mainly of two parts:
1. The "activity name".
2. The "default user rating".

### Activity name
All activities must have a name. Use something meaningful.

### Default user rating
Any new user participating in the quiz initially gets this default user rating.

### Saving the activity
Scroll down to the bottom of the page and press the [Save and display] button to start the quiz setup. You are then taken to the question list setup.

## [Question lists](https://github.com/KQMATH/moodle-mod_capquiz/wiki/Question-lists)

The question list is the contents of a CAPQuiz activity.
The question list is a collection of questions from the Moodle
question bank with difficulty ratings.  
Setting up a CAPQuiz activitity, the curation of the question list
is always the most important and time-consuming task.

One are presented a view where he can choose to either:
* copy an existing question list template as the basis for the new quiz.
* create a new question list from scratch.

Read more about [Question lists](https://github.com/KQMATH/moodle-mod_capquiz/wiki/Question-lists).

### 1. Use template
If an question list template is available for use, they are listed under "Select one of these templates for your quiz". Select the desired template.

### 2. Create Question List
The question list needs a title and a description.

One must also set the rating thresholds for student achievement. The students will get up to **five stars** along the way, and the threshold must be set for **each star**. These may be changed later.

When the setup is complete, the teacher enters the [Editing a quiz](https://github.com/KQMATH/moodle-mod_capquiz/wiki/Editing-a-quiz) interface.
