# Privacy

Using LTI means that personal information is propagated to one
more server.  As far as we know, there is no way to manage privacy
across LTI, so the consumer and the provider must each be managed
separately.

It could be useful to add features to bulk delete users created
for a particular LTI activity or course.  Unfortunately, such a feature
does not currently exist.
