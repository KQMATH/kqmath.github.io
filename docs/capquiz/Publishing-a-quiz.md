# Publishing a quiz
When questions have been added to the question list, the quiz can be published from the [dashboard](https://github.com/KQMATH/moodle-mod_capquiz/wiki/Editing-a-quiz#dashboard).

**Publish** means to open the quiz for students.

**Make template** means to publish a copy of the question list for reuse in other quiz activities.
