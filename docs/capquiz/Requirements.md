# Requirements

We aim to make the plugin compatible with any officially supported version of Moodle without requiring additional dependencies. We test on the last version and the last LTS version.

Currently, this means that CAPQuiz should run on Moodle 3.5 (LTS), 3.6, and 3.7, but our testing on 3.6 is limited.

## PHP version

To be compatible with Moodle 3.5, the minimum required PHP version is 7.0. For when Moodle 3.7 is the minimum version supported, the PHP version must be at least 7.1. (Last updated: June 2019)
