# Questions report

The CAPQuiz questions report allows the teacher to see a table of question ratings for questions used in a CAPQuiz. One row for each question rating. It provides a historical log of question rating updates tied to user attempts. Hence, it may be used to track each question's rating development. Primarily it shows the question's "new" rating and the question's previous rating. In addition, it also possible to show the question text.

## Report columns
### Attempt id (download only)
The id of the CAPQuiz attempt in which the rating update was done in.

### Question id
The id for the CAPQuiz question.

### Question rating
The question's rating before the student answered the question.

### Previous question rating
The question's rating after the student answered the question. If the (previous) question rating was made by the teacher, and not as a result of student attempts, a ‚ö†Ô∏è warning sign is displayed in front of the rating.

### Rating was manually updated (download only)
If the question rating was made by the teacher, and not as a result of student attempts, this column will be set to true. Otherwise, false (or null if nonexistent). This is only tied to the previous question rating.

### Moodle question id
The id for the Moodle question.

### Question text
The question's text. This is what the student is suppose to "answer". This is particularly helpful when the question is randomized.

### Time created
The date üìÖ (D:M:Y) and time üïê (H:M:S) the question rating update was done at.
