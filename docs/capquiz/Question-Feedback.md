Early versions of CAPQuiz had an interface where the students could
make comments on the questions or their solutions.
This functionality will be removed to a separate plugin:
[qtracker](https://github.com/KQMATH/moodle-local_qtracker)

At the time of writing (July 2020) this is still work in progress.
The old comment interface will not be documented.
