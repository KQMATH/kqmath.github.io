# Tips and tricks
## LaTeX generation for correct answer(s)
To speed up the authoring process, one may preview the question and use its WYSIWYG editor.

1. Open the [question preview](https://github.com/KQMATH/moodle-qtype_shortmath/wiki/Authoring-a-question#question-preview).
2. Write the wanted mathematical expression into the WYSIWYG editor.
3. Submit/check the answer.
4. Copy the submitted answer from the bottom of the row "Action", under "Response history". Be sure not to copy the prefix `\[` and the postfix `\]` from the response.
