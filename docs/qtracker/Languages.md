QTracker is part of Moodle. Hence, we have used the Moodle translation management system.  

Please check if QTracker has already been translated into your language. We are using [Moodle's AMOS system](http://docs.moodle.org/en/AMOS).

It is convenient to translate the strings online. To translate QTracker into another language please use Moodle's AMOS system.  See [Moodle online documentation](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/AMOS_manual) for specific details.
