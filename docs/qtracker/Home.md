# QTracker

Question Tracker - Issue Tracker for Question Development

QTracker provides a system to record and manage reported problems
with moodle questions.

1. Students get a user interface where they can report problems, be that
   functional errors in the question or feedback which is uninstructive.
2. Teachers get a user interface where issues can be reviewed and sorted,
   and checked off as resolved.

Two plugins are required

+ [The local plugin](https://moodle.org/plugins/local_qtracker) which
  implements the question database
+ [The block plugin](https://moodle.org/plugins/block_qtracker)
  which provides the student user interface.
