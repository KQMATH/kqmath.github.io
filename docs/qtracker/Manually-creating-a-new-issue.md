# Manually creating a new issue
To manually create a new issue you must be logged in as a student.

## Log in as student
To log in as a student, click your profile on the top-right of the screen, regardless of page.
In the menu which now appears, click "Switch role to...". This will open a page where you can simply click the role you wish to be logged in as
To revert this, simply click your profile again and click "Return to my normal role"

Now that you are logged in as a student, open the quiz and create a new issue the same way a student would:
