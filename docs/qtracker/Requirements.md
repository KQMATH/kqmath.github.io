# Requirements

We aim to make the plugin compatible with any officially supported version of Moodle without requiring additional dependencies. We test on the last version and the last LTS version.

Currently, this means that QTracker should run on Moodle 3.9 (LTS).

## PHP version

To be compatible with Moodle 3.9, the minimum required PHP version is 7.2 (Last updated: August 2020).
