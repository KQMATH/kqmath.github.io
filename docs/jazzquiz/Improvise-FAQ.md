# Improvisation FAQ

## I have a new question type.  How do I improvise?

The teacher is using JazzQuiz, and discovers or develops a new question type not currently used or supported by JazzQuiz.

How should the teacher create a new IMPROV-question?

The teacher should be able to add it once to be available for all activities in his course. He may not have the permissions to add it system level.

### Admin scenario.

The site users agree that the new question type should be available for improvisation for everyone. How can the admin add an IMPROV-question for all courses?

### There are so many improvisation questions. How can I clean up the list?

Can the user remove or disable some IMPROV-questions from his course?

Can the admin remove or disable some IMPROV-questions from the site?

### I was searching the question bank. What are all these IMPROV-questions?

### What happens if I delete an IMPROV-question?

### Can I edit an IMPROV-question in the the question bank?

### I have a normal question which I use often, with the same question text.  Can I add it as an IMPROV-question?

For example. I want to ask the class if I progress too slowly (A), at just the right rate (B), or to quickly (C). Leafing through the Jump-list is tedious; and it would be much simpler if I could make this an IMPROV-question.
