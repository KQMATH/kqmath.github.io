# Custom questions for improvisation

Improvisation questions are added to the question bank just like any other question; they are recognised by the title which must be prefixed by the string `{IMPROV}` (with braces, no leading or trailing space). All question with this title prefix from any category available from the activity, will be included in the improvise menu in the JazzQuiz activity.

Note that IMPROV questions should not (normally) be added to the quiz activity itself. If they are, they will be included in the question sequence in addition to being available from the «improvise» menu.
