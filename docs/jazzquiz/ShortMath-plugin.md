JazzQuiz was conceived and originally created for use in mathematics modules. Therefore a companion plugin called [ShortMath](https://github.com/KQMATH/moodle-qtype_shortmath) has been created to support mathematical questions.

The plugin is available at the official [Moodle repos](https://moodle.org/plugins/qtype_shortmath), and on  [GitHub](https://github.com/KQMATH/moodle-qtype_shortmath).

Usage is straight forward. The question edit interface is identical to that of [Short Answer](https://docs.moodle.org/36/en/Short-Answer_question_type), but the students get a maths editor to write their response (WYSIWYG). For more documentation, see the [ShortMath Wiki](https://github.com/KQMATH/moodle-qtype_shortmath/wiki).
