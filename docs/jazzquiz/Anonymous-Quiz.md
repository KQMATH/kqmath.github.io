# Anonymity levels

Starting a session, the teacher has to choose the level of anonymity.

## Anonymous answers (Attendance can be seen)

This option gives the teacher access to an attendance list after the session, showing who took part.
However, the answers given are anonymous, and the teacher cannot see who answered what. 
After the session is complete, no link exists between the student identities and the answers given.

## Fully anonymous

In this case the student identites are kept completely hidden from the teacher. 
Contrary to the above option, no attendance list is available.

## Non-anonymous session

This option gives the teacher access to complete reports after the session, showing who answered what.

# Allow guests

Independently of the level of anonymity, the teacher may or may not allow the students to log in as guest and join the quiz.  Guest users are always anonymous, regardless of the level of anonymity, since they are never prompted for their name.
