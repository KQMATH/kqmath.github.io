# Please note

The original plugin, Realtime Quiz, was written by Davo Smith: moodle@davosmith.co.uk

Afterwards came ActiveQuiz, funded by an educational innovation grant given to the Medical school, the University of Wisconsin - Madison. The plugin was rewritten to integrate the core Moodle question engine. John Hoopes: john.z.hoopes@gmail.com
