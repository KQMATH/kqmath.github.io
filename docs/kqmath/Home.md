# KQMATH
Welcome to the official documentation for the [KQMATH](https://github.com/KQMATH) organization.  
Also, see description on [Confluence](http://confluence.uials.no:8090/display/KQMATHPUB/Klasseromsquiz+i+Matematikk) [Norwegian].

## Who are we?

We are the Moodle Team at the [Norwegian University of Science and Technology](https://www.ntnu.no) (NTNU),
[Department of ICT and Natural Sciences](https://www.ntnu.edu/iir/department-of-ict-and-natural-sciences).

## Moodle plugins

We have developed a number of Moodle plugins which have been published:
* [CAPQuiz activity module](https://moodle.org/plugins/mod_capquiz), view [source](https://github.com/KQMATH/moodle-mod_capquiz) or [wiki](https://github.com/KQMATH/moodle-mod_capquiz/wiki).
* [JazzQuiz activity module](https://moodle.org/plugins/mod_jazzquiz), view [source](https://github.com/KQMATH/moodle-mod_jazzquiz) or [wiki](https://github.com/KQMATH/moodle-mod_jazzquiz/wiki).
* [QTracker local module](https://moodle.org/plugins/local_qtracker),
  view [source](https://github.com/KQMATH/moodle-local_qtracker)
  and the associated
    * [QTracker block module](https://moodle.org/plugins/block_qtracker)
      view [source](https://github.com/KQMATH/moodle-block_qtracker)
* [ShortMath question type](https://moodle.org/plugins/qtype_shortmath), view [source](https://github.com/KQMATH/moodle-qtype_shortmath) or [wiki](https://github.com/KQMATH/moodle-qtype_shortmath/wiki).

## Libraries
<!--
We also contribute to other Moodle plugins:

-->

The following libraries have been developed for use in the ShortMath plugin above:
* [TeX2Max](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tex2max), view [source](https://github.com/KQMATH/tex2max).
* [Visual math input](https://github.com/KQMATH/visual-math-input), view [source](https://github.com/KQMATH/visual-math-input) or [wiki](https://github.com/KQMATH/visual-math-input/wiki).

## Documentation

Apologies for the rudimentary documentation.  This has been hacked together based
on experience running a rogue moodle server as joint teacher and developer.
Some things will have to be done differently when a production system is set up
for wider use.

* User documentation:
    * [Add an activity to a Moodle course](Add-an-activity-to-a-Moodle-course)
* [Developer documentation](Developer-documentation) (Release Policy)

## Moodle Activities in other Learning Management Systems

At NTNU in Ã…lesund, we have used Moodle activities within the university's official
LMS, BlackBoard.  
The advantage of this is that we can use BlackBoard's user management.
The students have everything in one place, and the teacher does not have to manage
class lists.
It is also possible to feed assessment results in moodle back into BlackBoard.

* [Learning Tools Interoperability](Learning-Tools-Interoperability) (LTI).

  2. [Moodle as an LTI Tool consumer](Learning-Tools-Interoperability#moodle-as-an-lti-tool-consumer).
* [Add Moodle integration in Blackboard course](Add-Moodle-integration-in-Blackboard-course)
